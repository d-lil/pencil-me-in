# pencil-me-in## Description

-A simple planner made to help organize tasks by the hour for a busy work day.
-Color changing hourly blocks help to visualize what important tasks have passed, are currently needing to be done, and need to be done in the future.
-Learned how to simplify code to get much longer code into an easier to read format for simple tasks.

You can type tasks into the hourly blocks and save them, so if the page refreshes they are still there.
